/*
Constants 
If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change 
throughout the program, it's recommended to use const so as to prevent any
errors later on due to changing on variables not meant to be changed. 

! It isn't possible to declare constants without initializing them.

Example:
! const x;  // Error! Missing initializer in const declaration.
! x = 5;
! console.log(x)
*/
const example_2 = "yo";
console.log(example_2);
